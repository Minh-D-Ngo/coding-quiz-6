Plus Minus:

Time Complexity:
Reading the input list of integers and performing the calculations for positive, 
negative, and zero values in the list takes O(n) time, where 'n' is the number of 
integers in the input list. So, the overall time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the `plusMinus` function is O(1) because it uses a 
constant amount of extra space to store variables which do not depend on the 
size of the input list. The space complexity of the `main` function is also O(1).
Thus, the code has a space complexity of O(1).
